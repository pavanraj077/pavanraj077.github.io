      <h2>About </h2>
      <p>An 'About Us' page is a spot for your founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing question new customers have about your business.<br>What an 'About Us' page should be is a goal-oriented sales page, one that focuses on highlighting the biggest selling points of your story and brand at the top of the page, making a strong first impression on curious customers<br>In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page is the ideal place to accommodate a number of objectives:<br>Your 'About Us' page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure and design.</p>
      <h2>Moon</h2>
      <p>When in doubt, start with a question. That’s exactly what Magic Spoon—a brand that creates healthy cereals for grownups—does with the introductory paragraph on its About Us page.<br>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet,[f] with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).<br>The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System.<br>It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density. </p>
